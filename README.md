This is a compilation of random pieces of code I used for research projects! 
This only includes projects where I am either a major or sole contributor to the code. 

## Past projects: 
### Effect of Moss Thickness and Drought Conditions on Tree Germination
Took height measurements and germination dates of *Pseudotsuga menziesii* grown from seed planted in varying levels of *Thuidium delicatulum* moss thickness, which were then treated with either drought or no drought. Then, all of the data was analyzed and graphed via R. Methods used were 2-way ANOVA, boxplots, and histograms. Seedling death data was added midway through the experiment. Coded in R using RStudio.

## Current projects:
### Kokanee Salmon Fry variables in Random Forest Algorithm
Using kokanee salmon fry data collected from volunteers, data was cleaned up manually via Google Sheets, then put through a Random Forest algorithm to determine if any of the variables had correlations. Currently fixing issues with the code. Currently teaching myself and trying to understand Random Forest better! Coding in R using RStudio.

### Glass Cliff Phenomenon (not publicly available)
Database is stored in GoogleSheets and uses SQL. Currently branching into R for more statistical and qualitative data visualization work!
